## General Information
- #### Background:
 The comapny BoomBikes (A US bike-sharing provider) to accelerate its revenue, aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people. They have    planned this to stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
 They want to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends.
- #### Business Problem:
  We need to build a model to predict the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables to understand how exactly the demands vary with       different features. The management can then accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations and understand the demand dynamics of a new market.  
- #### DataSet :
  Data set gathered is based on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.


## Conclusions
We can see the demand for bikes depends mainly on below variables:
- Time related fetaures : yr , Holiday,Sep
- Weather related fetaures: atemp ,Spring, Mist_Cloudy, Light rain_Light snow_Thunderstorm

- Demand Increases :
With Year, In month of Sep, atemp

- Demand Decreases:
Spring, Mist_Cloudy, Light rain_Light snow_Thunderstorm, On Holiday

## Technologies Used
- Jupyter Notebook Server
